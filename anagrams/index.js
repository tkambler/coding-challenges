/**
 * Creates a function (anagrams) that accepts two strings: string1 and string2
 *
 * The function should return `true` if the two strings are anagrams. If the two strings are not
 * anagrams, then the function should return `false`. The capitalization of the strings
 * should not matter.
 *
 * Two strings are anagrams if they are comprised of the same letters, but in a different order.
 * For example, the following strings are anagrams:
 *
 * - night, thing
 * - peach, cheap
 *
 * To test your implementation, open the terminal and run: npm test
